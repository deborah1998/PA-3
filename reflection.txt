What did you learn, What would you do differently next time, What was difficult, How were functions useful?
In this programming assignment I learned how to check for errors by writing a series of if statements and even incorporating
while loops to help prevent error  which we just learned in class.This programming assignment also helped me practice writing functions and helped
me learn when to call them and this programming assignment also further helped me learn how to memorize the structure of functions
as well.Next time I  think that instead of putting all of my input statements under one single function i will put my input statements in my
main and type cast them there  so that my code is more readable and more neat.What I thought was difficult was actually coming up
with the min and max functions.I had to go back to old notes and online homework to figure out exactly how to create those min
and max functions and actually get them to work.I also struggle with coming up with the equations for the gymnastics calculations
but I eventually understood what i was supposed to go and got that calculation to work.In this programming assignment the functions were extremley
useful because it shortens the amount of code I would have if we couldn't use functions.Functions were also useful to call when you
need them so you don't have to keep doing the same thing over and over to certain aspects of the  code by just repeating steps
when you could just put that one step  it in one function  and call it it when you need it.Functions in this lab helped make the
code more coherent.
