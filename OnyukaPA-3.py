# Programming Assignment:PA3
# Problem Statement:Create a program that will calculate various sports statistics for the user, based on the userâ€™s choice of statistic.
# Data In:A series of inputs to questions that will then be used in order to  calculate certain sports statistics.
# Data Out: The results of those specific calculations made by the users choice of statistic
# Credits:Class Notes  on functions and while loops




#Purpose:checks to see if the answer inputs a numeric value
#Parameters:prompt
#Return:the user's valid input converted to an int
