Function Name:quarterback_rating
Parameters:completions,attempts,passing-yards,touchdown-passes,interceptions
Return:
100 * [5(completions/attempts – 0.3) + 0.25(passing-yards/attempts-3) + 20(touchdown-passes/attempts)+ 2.375 –
(25 * interceptions/attempts)]/6
Algorithm:
1.Perform the quarterback_rating calculation, store the QB calculation in result
2.Output the result of the calculation to the user


Function Name:strength_factor
Parameters:N,Sr8,Sr16,Sr32,Sr64,Sr100,Jr16
Return:[N/10 + 7(Sr8) + 6(Sr16) + 5(Sr32) + 4(Sr64) + 3(Jr16) + 2(Sr100)]/100
Algorithm:
1.Perform the strength_factor calculation, store the strength factor calculation in result
2.Output the result of the strength factor calculation

Function Name:gymnast_finalscore
Parameters:highest score,lowest score, score3,score4,score5,score6
Return:((highest score + lowest score + score3+score4+score5)-(highest score+lowest score)/3) + score6
Algorithm:
1.Perform the gymnast_final score calculation, store calculation in the result
2.Output the result of the calculation to the user

Function Name:Menu
Parameters:None
Return:chosen menu option
Algorithm:
1.Tell the user their options for the  sport  that the program will calculate statistics for(football, fencing or gymnastics).
