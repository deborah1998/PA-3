Function Name:read_int
Parameters:None
Return:An integer value input by the user
1.)Prompt the user to input a number for completions.
2.)Prompt the user to input a number for attempts.
3.)Prompt the user to input a number for passing yards.
4.)Prompt the user to input a number for touchdown passes.
5.)Typecast inputs to floats.
6.)Return typecasted numbers.




Function Name:quarterback_rating
Parameters:completions,attempts,passing-yards,touchdown-passes,interceptions
Return:
100 * [5(completions/attempts – 0.3) + 0.25(passing-yards/attempts-3) + 20(touchdown-passes/attempts)+ 2.375 –
(25 * interceptions/attempts)]/6
Algorithm:
1.Perform the quarterback_rating calculation, store the QB calculation in result
2.Output the result of the calculation to the user


Function Name:strength_factor
Parameters:N,Sr8,Sr16,Sr32,Sr64,Sr100,Jr16
Return:[N/10 + 7(Sr8) + 6(Sr16) + 5(Sr32) + 4(Sr64) + 3(Jr16) + 2(Sr100)]/100
Algorithm:
1.Perform the strength_factor calculation, store the strength factor calculation in result
2.Output the result of the strength factor calculation

Function Name:gymnast_finalscore
Parameters:highest score,lowest score, score3,score4,score5,score6
Return:((highest score + lowest score + score3+score4+score5)-(highest score+lowest score)/3) + score6
Algorithm:
1.Perform the gymnast_final score calculation, store calculation in the result
2.Output the result of the calculation to the user

Function Name:Menu
Parameters:None
Return:chosen menu option
Algorithm:
1.Tell the user their options for the  sport  that the program will calculate statistics for(football, fencing or gymnastics).
2.Ask the user to input the  choice of sport statistic they would like to do their calculation for
3.Return the choice


Function Name: Main
Parameters: None
Return: None
Algorithm:
1.Tell the user the purpose of the program
2.Call menu to determine choice
3.if choice is football
    a.call input_footballnumbers
    b.call quarterback_rating, given the inputted values store return value in answer
    c.if answer is greater than or equal to 158.3
        d.output "You are a perfect passer"
    e.otherwise if attempts equals zero
    f.end program
    g.otherwise
        f.ouput answer
4. otherwise if choice is fencing
    a.call input_fencing numbers
    b.call strength_factor, given the inputted values store return value in answer
    c.output answer
5.otherwise if choice is gymnastics
    a.call input_gymnasticsnumbers
    b.call gymnast_finalscore
    c.output answer
