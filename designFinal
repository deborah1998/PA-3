Function Name:read_int
Parameters:prompt
Return:An integer value input by the user
1.)Prompt the user to input a number value.
2.)if number.isdigit()
    a.return the number typecasted to an int
3.)elif number does not equal number.isdigit()
    a.ouput "This input  is not valid !"
    b.return zero

Function Name:quarterback_rating
Parameters:none
Return:(100 * ((5*(completions / attempts - 0.3 )+ 0.25*(passingyards / attempts - 3) + 20*(touchdownpasses / attempts)+ 2.375-(25 * interceptions / attempts))) / 6)
Algorithm:
1.)Prompt the user to input a number for completions store it in the variable completions.
2.)call the read_int function to convert  input for completions to an int
3.)Prompt the user to input a number for attempts store it in the variable attempts.
4.)call the read_int function to convert  input for attempts to an int
5.) while attempts <=0:
        a.output"This is an invalid input.You can't have zero or less attempts!"
        b.prompt the user to enter the number of attempts
        c.call the read_int function to convert  input for attempts to an int

6.)Prompt the user to input a number for passing yards store it in the variable passing yards.
7.)call the read_int function to convert  input for passing yards to an int
8.)Prompt the user to input a number for touchdown passes store it in the variable touchdown passes.
9.)call the read_int function to convert  input for touchdown passes to an int
10.)Prompt the user to input a number for interceptions store it in the variable interceptions.
11.)call the read_int function to convert input for interceptions to an int
12.)Perform the calculation:
(100 * ((5*(completions / attempts - 0.3 )+ 0.25*(passingyards / attempts - 3) + 20*(touchdownpasses / attempts)+ 2.375-(25 * interceptions / attempts))) / 6),
store the QB calculation in result
13.)if result is greater than or equal to 158.3:
    a.output"They are a perfect passer!"
14.)elif result  is less than 158.3 and result is greater than or equal to zero:
    a.output"The quarterback rating of this player is ,result,"They are not a perfect passer"
15.)else:
    a.output""The quarterback rating of this player is ,result,"that is an invalid answer you gave bad input!"
16.) return result

Function Name:strength_factor
Parameters:none
Return:(((N / 10 )+ (7* Sr8) + (6*Sr16) + (5*Sr32) + (4 *Sr64) + (3*Jr16) + (2*Sr100)) /(100))
Algorithm:
1.)Prompt the user to input a number for number of fencing participants
2.)Prompt the user to input a number for No. of fencers ranked 1-8 in the World Cup standings.
3.)Prompt the user to input a number for No. of fencers ranked 9-16 in the World Cup standings.
4.)Prompt the user to input a number for No. of fencers ranked 17-32 in the World Cup standings.
5.)Prompt the user to input a number for No. of fencers ranked 33-64 in the World Cup standings.
6.)Prompt the user to input a number for No. of fencers ranked  65-100 in the World Cup standings.
7.)Prompt the user to input a number for No. of fencers ranked 1-16 in the Junior World Cup standings.
8.)Typecast inputs to floats.
9.)Return typecasted numbers.








Function Name:gymnast_finalscore
Parameters:highest score,lowest score, score3,score4,score5,score6
Return:((highest score + lowest score + score3+score4+score5)-(highest score+lowest score)/3) + score6
Algorithm:
1.Perform the gymnast_final score calculation, store calculation in the result
2.Output the result of the calculation to the user

Function Name:Menu
Parameters:None
Return:chosen menu option
Algorithm:
1.Tell the user their options for the  sport  that the program will calculate statistics for(football, fencing or gymnastics).
2.Ask the user to input the  choice of sport statistic they would like to do their calculation for
3.Return the choice


Function Name: Main
Parameters: None
Return: None
Algorithm:
1.Tell the user the purpose of the program
2.Call menu to determine choice
3.if choice is football
    a.call input_footballnumbers
    b.call quarterback_rating, given the inputted values store return value in answer
    c.if answer is greater than or equal to 158.3
        d.output "You are a perfect passer"
    e.otherwise if attempts equals zero
    f.end program
    g.otherwise
        f.ouput answer
4. otherwise if choice is fencing
    a.call input_fencing numbers
    b.call strength_factor, given the inputted values store return value in answer
    c.output answer
5.otherwise if choice is gymnastics
